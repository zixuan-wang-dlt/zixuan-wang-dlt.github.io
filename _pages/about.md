Hi! I am **Zixuan Wang**. I am a second-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://ece.princeton.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at Princeton University. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://jasondlee88.github.io/">Prof. Jason D. Lee</a>.

My research interests broadly lie in understanding **the foundations of LLMs and deep learning**, as well as leveraging
both theoretical and empirical explorations to advance the frontiers of deep learning and language modeling.

I did my undergraduate in Institutes for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University (Known as **"Yao class"**).

You can contact me at wangzx (at) princeton (dot) edu.
